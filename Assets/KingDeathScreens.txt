You noticed that the king likes to rest at his balcony. You clould make an accident out of this. You decided to saw the railings a bit. You sneaked into the kings chambers and started the craft. You almost fell of the balcony as someone at the corridor shouted "Is someone there?". Fortunately, it was the king who fell and noone knows it was you. Long live the king!

The king invited you for a banquet. It's a perfect occasion! While at the party, you sneaked into the kitchen to poison the kings drink. Suddenly, someone shouted: "WHO ARE YOU?!". "I'm... WAITER, yes, waiter" you responsed. "THEN GET BACK TO WORK RIGHT NOW!" shouted the guy who turned out to be the chef. "Y-yes" you stuttered as you left with the kings dish, adding the pioson on the way. The king choked to death, and the chef was put to blame. Serves him right!

Tomorrow the king is going to meet with another two kings of neighbouring countries. You can't think of a better opportunity. The plan is perfect. You volounteer to be a guard of the carriage. When getting close to a bridge you kill the driver and direct the carriage into a valley, jumping off in the last second. The plan was success, and no one lives to tell the tale. Long live me!

Powder. 
Inn.
KABOOOOOOOOOM!

Today the king is going to train swordsmanship with his guard. And you are a genius plotter. You replaced fake swords with real ones at night. During the training you used a mirror to blind the king and SLASH, unfortunate accident has happened. With no evidence aganist you. GENIUS

What could happen if someone forgot to lock the stable as the king was going home when it started to storm? Exactly, the king become one with the ground.

Getting a poisonous snake was a hard task, but how rewarding!

Loose saddle straps at a wolf hunt? What could go wrong!
